git status #gives status
git log #shows history of commits

Add/Commit/Push
git add <file name> #adds a file to the staging area
git add . (adds all changes)
git commit -m "description of upload" #commits to the local repository with a message
git push origin "name of branch"
git push --all origin (push all branches to origin)

Branching
git checkout <name> #moves to the branch <name>
git checkout <commit hash> #moves to a certain commit in the past (past hash found with git log)
git branch #lists branches in repository
git branch <name> #creates new branch
git checkout -b <name of branch> #creates a branch with a new name and moves to that branch (short for git branch <name>; git checkout <name>)
git branch -d <name of branch> #deletes branch locally
git push --delete origin <brach name> #deletes branch remotely
git push origin :<branch name> #another way of deleting it remotely
git stash #stash your changes on a feature branch without commiting -> move branch to do some other stuff (only stashes added files)
git stash pop #moved back to feature branch and this restores the stashed changes

Merging
git checkout main # switch to main branch 1st
git merge <name of branch  -to be merged>
git merge --squash <name of branch> # merges the branch into main without creating a merge commit 
#thus creates a single commit on main branch containing all changes from source branch
#but doesn't preserve history of source branch
git --rebase #adds all changes on branch linearly to the master branch #don't use if multiple people working

Retrieving data
git fetch --all (fetch to check first copies into repository but not workflosw)
git pull --all 
git pull origin "name" 
git remote prune origin %update branches etc from online repository
